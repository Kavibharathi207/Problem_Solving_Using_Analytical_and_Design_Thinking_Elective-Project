# Building Trust in Smart Agriculture  
### Problem Solving Using Analytical and Design Thinking

This repository contains my **Design Thinking elective course project**, focused on improving **trust, adoption, and usability of ML-based smart agriculture systems** for farmers in rural India.

---

## 📌 Project Domain
**Smart Agriculture**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Despite the availability of machine learning–based smart agriculture systems, many farmers hesitate to adopt them due to:
- Lack of trust in ML predictions  
- Poor explainability of system outputs  
- Insufficient training and onboarding  
- Low digital literacy  

As a result, data-driven farming benefits remain largely unrealized.

## 👤 Target User Persona
**Name:** Ramesh Kumar  
**Age:** 55–60 years  
**Occupation:** Small to medium-scale farmer  
**Location:** Rural India  
**Tech Comfort:** Basic smartphone usage  

**Goals:**
- Improve crop yield  
- Reduce financial loss  
- Make informed farming decisions  

---

## ❤️ Empathy Insights
Farmers:
- **Say:** “I don’t know if I can trust these predictions.”  
- **Think:** “What if I make the wrong decision and lose my crops?”  
- **Do:** Rely on traditional farming methods  
- **Feel:** Confused, skeptical, and anxious about ML outputs
